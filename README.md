My Build
=======

I have forked https://github.com/SecrecySupportTeam/secrecy , because there are some things I want this app to be able to do,
but I'm not sure that the main developer will accept. I also don't like how the current app looks and that's another reason to fork it.

What I've done so far?
- Fixed several annoying crashes.
- Fixed bug which (when started for the first time) did not show the "Create vault" and "Restore from backup" buttons.
- Added saving view state ( list or gallery ) per vault. It will be in the same state when opened next time.
- Added animated GIF support.

I really hope you enjoy it :)

secrecy (original Readme)
=======================

Secrecy is where you can safely put your files without worrying that others will see it... They just can't.

I am starting this project since I have tried a number of Apps for secure file storage, while not finding one that best suits my expectations:
- some, like Vaulty and Hide it pro, do not store videos securely and just stores the raw file
- most only support storing pictures and videos. I occasionally want to store word documents but can't find a way.
- some produced by major software companies are simply bloated and litters temp files everywhere... That's just as insecure as not using them.

I am aiming to produce an all-rounded one that maximizes security but still ensuring ease of use and quick encryption time.
